# Issues + future plans 
I had fun making this project. A known issue is the fact that the best score resets when you refresh the app. This could be solved using local storage, but I left it there as a way to start over from the beginning. Other fun things is that the corret answers show themselves after every round. There was an issue before where if you were to spam the button during the setInterval before it switches to the next question, the score keeps incrementing, but I fixed it with a disabled button. The utility functions are all stored within the util directory! I had some fun coming up with nice ideas to mix up the data set. In the future some additional features i would like to have to make the app more awesome is having a time mode, where you have a certain amount of time to answer the question AND also potentially a mulitplayer mode (maybe utlizing sockets).
